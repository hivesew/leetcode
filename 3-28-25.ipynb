    "# 2243. Calculate Digit Sum of a String\n",
    "You are given a string `s` consisting of digits and an integer `k`.  \n",
    "A **round** can be completed if the length of `s` is greater than `k`. In one round, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Divide** `s` into **consecutive groups** of size `k` such that the first `k` characters are in the first group, the next `k` characters are in the second group, and so on. **Note** that the size of the last group can be smaller than `k`.\n",
    "2. **Replace** each group of `s` with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, `\"346\"` is replaced with `\"13\"` because `3 + 4 + 6 = 13`.\n",
    "3. **Merge** consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than `k`, repeat from step `1`.\n",
    "Return `s` after all rounds have been completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**  \n",
    "**Input:** s = \"11111222223\", k = 3 \n",
    "**Output:** \"135\"  \n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: \"111\", \"112\", \"222\", and \"23\".  \n",
    "  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5.  \n",
    "  So, s becomes \"3\" + \"4\" + \"6\" + \"5\" = \"3465\" after the first round.  \n",
    "- For the second round, we divide s into \"346\" and \"5\".  \n",
    "  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5.  \n",
    "  So, s becomes \"13\" + \"5\" = \"135\" after second round.   \n",
    "Now, s.length <= k, so we return \"135\" as the answer.  \n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 2**  \n",
    "**Input:** s = \"00000000\", k = 3  \n",
    "**Output:** \"000\"  \n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "We divide s into \"000\", \"000\", and \"00\".  \n",
    "Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0.   \n",
    "s becomes \"0\" + \"0\" + \"0\" = \"000\", whose length is equal to k, so we return \"000\".  \n"
